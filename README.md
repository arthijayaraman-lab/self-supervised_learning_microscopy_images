Paper: Self-supervised machine learning model for analysis of nanowire morphologies from transmission electron microscopy images in chemrixv
## Dataset
The peptide / protein nanowires used in this study were synthesized and imaged by Brian Montz in Prof. Todd Emrick's research group at the Department of Polymer Science and Engineering Department, University of Massachusetts Amherst. The TEM image dataset of the nanowire morphologies is hosted on Zenodo open-access data repository, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6377141
